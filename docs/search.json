    "text": "AI systems are a direct product of the data used to train and evaluate them, and the data is a direct product of the processes we put in place to generate it. Work over the past decade has emerged explaining limitations of commonly re-used datasets, with many commonly used ‘benchmark’ datasets showing a lack of representativeness (Hullman et al., 2022), measurement quality (Jacobs & Wallach, 2021), accounting for the full range of reasonable interpretations in terms of annotations (Cabitza et al., 2023), and completeness in reporting of the annotation process (Geiger et al., 2020, 2021). Although improvements to data collection processes have been proposed, they are at best slowly being adopted, and at worst being largely ignored. This issue is further exacerbated by the increasingly sophisticated qualities we aim to evaluate systems on, that in turn are challenging to define and measure (e.g. ‘intelligence’, ‘fairness’) (Jacobs & Wallach, 2021). Furthermore, the human-like behavior of the sophisticated systems we are evaluating are a prime target for anthropomorphistically biased mis-interpretations of their outputs, as many aim to behave similar to humans (Altmeyer et al., 2024). It is thus crucial that we put in place better practices, as the qualities of AI systems in the future will be determined by practices we set in place today: the efforts we spend to refine how we design, collect and analyze training/evaluation data will determine the real-world performance of the AI systems we will build.\nDeveloping better data design, collection, and analysis practices requires substantial efforts. As an example, the case study in this thesis proposes enriching design, collection, analysis and reporting of training/evaluation data for AI systems, using knowledge from the social sciences (Beck et al., 2022), metrology (measurement science) (Welty et al., 2019), and work in the computational sciences on ‘ground-truthing’ (Cabitza et al., 2023). It requires empirical investigation of the data collection process in addition to the data collection process itself, in principle for every combination of construct (i.e. the latent phenomenon of interest being measured), content (e.g. text, video, audio etc. but perhaps also subgroups, e.g. tweets vs. podcast transcripts vs. formal speeches etc.), and for relevant characteristics of annotators (i.e. ethnicity, political affiliation, etc.). Open questions remain for the primary case-study as well as for the field as a whole, all of which anticipate future studies, and by extension further efforts.\nQuestions remain as to how AI research as it is currently conducted can implement these solutions. As it stands, components of our current knowledge gathering apparatus - science as it is now practiced and reported - is overburdened. The ever increasing volume of published manuscripts related to “AI” makes it impossible to stay abreast of the overall field: 10% of over 4 million publications indexed on the SCOPUS academic database in 2024, up from around 7% in 2022, had terms related to AI in their title, keywords or abstracts (see Appendix A). The number of submitted manuscripts also shows increases year over year, with conferences like NeurIPS receiving upwards of 12k submissions in 20231, making it more and more difficult to find reviewers, and by extension to monitor the overall quality of the field (Zhang et al., 2022). PhD candidates, who already contribute a substantial proportion of academic work (Larivière, 2012) are bogged down by requirements to write and defend theses, despite the decreasing trend of thesis citations over time (Larivière et al., 2008), and evidence that PhD candidates with fixed duration contracts exceed that duration by several months (Van de Schoot et al., 2013) - efforts which could be put towards meeting some of this labor gap. It is not surprising then, that evidence of Large Language Model (LLM) use is showing in academic work, in both peer reviews (Liang et al., 2024) and in the papers themselves (Gray, 2024), raising even more questions about the overall quality of the scientific process.\nThis conclusiory manuscript thus highlights the crucial challenge for academic study of AI in the coming decade: how best to develop an infrastructure that allows for the study of how best to build systems with little - or at the very least, substantially less - harmful bias. It highlights the need for identifiable academic publication venues that gather works on the study of ground-truthing, more modern publication formats that allow for dataset requirements to be studied prior to their collection, and for infrastructure that allows the burden of their collection to be distributed among stakeholders. It concludes that, while works like the case study embedded in this thesis are necessary, the various fields studying topics related to AI are poorly positioned to implement them.\n\n\n-Despite growing recognition of dataset problems, actual progress toward better ground-truth data practices, from collection, to analysis remains slow. - Current incentives prioritize speed, performance, and novelty rather than careful measurement design or long-term dataset stewardship.[maybe write instead what’s good about current work - i.e what have they prioritized so far] - The cost of collecting meaningful, high-quality datasets — particularly for complex constructs like values, intentions, or intelligence — is underappreciated and underfunded. [Thesis contributions here.] Whether a simple or complex ground-truthing problem, treating the phenomenon of interest like a construct has benefits. Collecting good data is expensive, but neglecting this cost leads to cascading problems in AI evaluation. - Without better practices, datasets remain opaque, unexamined, and prone to embedding systemic biases from the start.\n\n\n\n\nIn fields like psychology and medicine, Registered Reports emerged to separate the design of a study from its results, reducing biases like hindsight bias and outcome switching.\nOther fields actively study how to measure complex constructs: e.g., psychometrics for cognitive ability, epidemiology for disease burden, and criminology for recidivism. These fields show that developing good measurement instruments is a dedicated scientific effort — not a side activity.\nIf AI research depends critically on ground-truth data, then the field needs a dedicated research agenda focused on ground-truth design and measurement science. Beyond lessons learned in other fields are ground-truthing specific questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our ICSE-SEIS 2023 paper, we critique unscientific performance claims in AGI-related work.\nAGI research is especially vulnerable to confirmation bias, wishful thinking, and premature performance claims without rigorous benchmarks.\nDefining the constructs we aim to measure (e.g., “intelligence” in LLMs) must be a scientific task in itself. Intelligence may manifest differently in AI systems than in humans, requiring new conceptualizations and new measurement instruments.\nWithout careful construct definition and measurement, claims about AGI capabilities risk being scientifically meaningless.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicropublications are modular, peer-reviewed publications that focus on specific research artifacts like datasets, annotation protocols, or measurement plans.\nExtending the Registered Reports model, we can approve data collection protocols before data is collected, including sampling design, measurement instruments, and annotation strategies.\nDecentralized contributors (e.g., multiple labs or individuals) could publish individual datasets under a shared, peer-reviewed protocol.\nThis would move ground-truth collection toward transparent, modular, and cumulative science, rather than isolated, one-off efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur SEIS 2023 paper pushes for open, linked, reproducible artifacts, not just final models or results.\nOur CHI 2023 paper critiques the opacity of machine learning artifacts and calls for linking data, documentation, and transparent evaluation processes.\nAlexandria:\n\nA web platform combining Wikipedia-style collaborative editing with GitHub-style version control.\nSupports the CREDIT taxonomy for structured contributor recognition.\nProof of concept: Built almost entirely by student developers under supervision, showing that decentralized academic innovation is possible.\nA few additional steps would yield a fully operational infrastructure supporting micropublication of ground-truth artifacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers pre-register their ground-truth collection plans, including constructs, instruments, and expected properties of the data.\nPeer-reviewed protocols are made public before data collection.\nAnnotators, coders, and dataset curators are properly credited through micropublications.\nDatasets grow openly, collaboratively, with tracked provenance and version control.\nThis infrastructure builds trustworthy, reproducible foundations for the next generation of AI and AGI research.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AI/ML research community, conferences, funding agencies, and publishers must recognize ground-truth data creation as a first-class research contribution.\nNew formats like data-focused Registered Reports and micropublications should be adopted.\nBetter data design enables better science, more responsible innovation, and safer, more meaningful AI systems.\n\nIt’s the ‘real’ world of publication that matters. As Larivière (2012) note, a thesis defense is a more curated experience as the ‘peer reviewers’ are chosen by the supervisors of the student - on the other hand, peer reviewers in the world of academic publication are far broader than the networks of the PhD candidate’s supervisory staff. One study in Canada in 2012 showed that one third of all academic output comes form PhD students (Larivière, 2012). One study showed the decline of citations of PhD theses over time (Larivière et al., 2008). Perhaps there are other, more productive ways to contribute rather than taking the time to write a thesis."
